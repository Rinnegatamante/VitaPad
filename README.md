# VITAPAD


VitaPad allows you to use your PSVITA as a wireless PC controller. It supports Windows (both 32 and 64 bit) and Linux (port made by nyorem). In the future i'm planning to add also Mac Os X support and also add a proper fiddler for vJoy.

## Usage

* Install VPK file on PSVITA
* Open VitaPad on PSVITA
* Optional: [Install vJoy driver](https://github.com/njz3/vJoy/releases/download/v2.2.0.0/vJoySetup.2.2.0.signed.exe) on Windows PC for vJoy functionality
* Open VitaPad on PC
* Insert the IP showed on PSVITA on PC

## Controls Mapping

You can edit your controls mapping by editing the XML file inside the client folder (windows.xml / linux.xml)

Default mapping:

- DPAD = WASD
- Cross,Square,Triangle,Circle = IJKL
- L Trigger = Ctrl
- R Trigger = Spacebar
- Start = Enter
- Select = Shift
- Left Analog = DKeys
- Right Analog = 8,6,4,2
- Touchscreen = Mouse movement
- Retrotouch = Left/Right click
